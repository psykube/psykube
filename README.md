## The Psykube YAML

A .psykube.yml is required in the root for each app. This can be overridden with
the `-f` or `--file` flag on any command.

### Template Variables
The .psykube.yml allows for expanding variables using the `<<var.name>>` template syntax. The
following variables are available within the template:

| Var | Description
|---|---
| `metadata.namespace` | The namespace provided with the `--namespace` flag on the command.
| `metadata.cluster_name` | The name of the cluster.
| `metadata.name` | The name of the application.
| `env.{name}` | An environment variable referenced by name.

#### Example

```yaml
ingress:
  host: <<metadata.namespace>>.k8s.example.com
```

### .psykube.yml Reference
You can find a detailed example of the `.psykube.yml` in [reference/.psykube.yml](./reference/.psykube.yml)
More examples can be found in the example dir.

**NOTE:** There is also an example .travis.yml file with an example of how to deploy to google container engine.
